      <h3> The history:</h3>
      <p> </p>
      <font color="##131313">
      <p> The dream of a self-driving automobile goes as             far back as the middle ages, centuries prior to             the invention of the car. The evidence for this             comes from a sketching by Leonardo De Vinci that           was meant to be a rough blueprint for a                     self propelled cart.

          It was around the early part of the 20th century           that a real concerted effort to develop a                   driverlesscar that actually worked started to               take shape, beginning with the Houdina Radio               Control Company’s first public demonstration of a           driverless car in 1925.

          A year later, distributor Achen Motor also                 showcased a remote-controlled car called the               “Phantom Auto” on the streets of Milwaukee.

          In 2010, internet giant Google announced that some of its employees had spent the previous year secretly developing and testing a system for a self-driving car in the hopes of finding a solution that would reduce the number of car accidents each year by half. The project was headed by Sebastian Thrun, director of Stanford’s Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, and brought onboard engineers who worked on cars that competed in DARPA’s Challenge events. The goal was to launch a commercial vehicle by the year 2020.

		<h3> The five stages of autonomous driving:</h3>
		<font color="##131313">
		<p> </p>
		<b> • Level null:</b> It isn't autonom. The driver does everything by himself. He drives, steers, brakes, gives gas and pays attention to his surroundings. The vehicle does not undertake any intervention or has no technical prerequisites<p>
		<b> • Level one:</b> supports the driver with certain assistance systems, for example, with a blind spot warning system, a tracking warning system or a Bergan driving aid system.<p>
		<b> • Level two:</b> assumes individual tasks for the driver. At this stage, most manufacturers are up to date (as of June 2017). Automatic parking or a tracking function are among the most common systems. The traffic assistant can accelerate, brake and follow the preceding vehicle without driver intervention<p>
		<b> • Level hree:</b> is referred to as highly-automated driving. The car, for example, independently sets the turn signal, changes the track or adjusts its speed to the running traffic. The autopilot can still ask the driver to take over the steering again to steer the car by hand.<p>
		<b> • Level four:</b> defines the full automation. The car takes over all functions and only delivers them again if a situation can not be solved for the system.<p>
		<b> • Level five:</b> Man is in principle superfluous. The car and the system need only a goal input and the release to the start. <p>
